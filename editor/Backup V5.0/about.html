        <p class="section-subtitle">
          A founder, a broken stack of tools, and a decision to build something that remembers.
        </p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>From “just another site” to “living worlds”</h3>
        <p>
          Tyniweb started as a simple need: a way to build websites that didn’t forget how they were made.
          Most builders publish a page and throw away the process. Tyniweb keeps the process alive — in training tracks,
          wizards, portals, and a Control Center that understands the whole system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of hiding complexity, Tyniweb organizes it. Instead of overwhelming you, it teaches you. Instead of
          locking you into templates, it gives you an editor that can grow with your skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Why “Tyniweb”?</h3>
        <p>
          “Tyni” is a reminder that every world starts small. A single block, a single page, a single idea.
          Tyniweb is about building tiny, understandable pieces that connect into something much bigger — a multiverse
          of sites, portals, and experiences that all share a stable core.

        <h3>For founders who see the whole system</h3>
        <p>
          If you’ve ever felt “overwhelmed” by your own vision, Tyniweb is built for you. You’re not overwhelmed —
          you’re seeing the whole system. That’s exactly what a founder is supposed to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tyniweb gives you a place to put that vision: roles, training, extensions, membership, pricing, and testing
          all in one platform. You built the tool. Now we build the ecosystem. Then the business. Then the income.
          Then the future.
